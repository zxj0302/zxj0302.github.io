I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at the [University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Reynold Cheng](https://www.reynold.hku.hk/). My research focuses on **graph mining** and **network analysis**, with particular interest in:

- **Dense subgraph discovery** — scalable algorithms for finding dense structures in large graphs, including variants with negative weights
- **Echo chambers in social networks** — detection, measurement, and mitigation of polarization phenomena
- **Multi-attribute shortest path queries** — index structures for preference-weighted queries on road networks

Before joining HKU, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/) (CGPA: 92/100) in 2023, where I was honored as an Outstanding Graduate. I was awarded the National Scholarship twice (2020, 2022) during my undergraduate studies.

I am currently supported by the HKU Postgraduate Scholarship (2023–2027).
