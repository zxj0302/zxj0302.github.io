- Proposed CEP (Contraction–Expansion–Pruning), a scalable heuristic that outperforms peeling-based baselines on 60%+ of instances with 13×+ average speedup across 11 real-world and 175 synthetic graphs up to 10<sup>7</sup> nodes
- Designed CQM, a QPBO+MIQP pipeline delivering user-specified accuracy bounds or exact solutions with certificates of optimality, achieving 100×+ speedup over exact baselines
