- Formulated Echo Chamber Core detection as a Purity-Aware Densest Subgraph problem combining structural density and stance entropy; proved NP-hardness and inapproximability
- Designed PADS-H, a greedy algorithm achieving 2×+ speedup over baselines and \<2s runtime on 1.67M-node graphs; applied to EC detection and polarization mitigation across real-world datasets
